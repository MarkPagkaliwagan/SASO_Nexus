                  To meet the needs of the growing school-age population of the City of San Pablo and its neighboring towns, a group of pioneering men, among them Major Ricardo Bonilla, Dr. Antonio Azores, Mr. Ambrosio Alcantara, and many others founded and established the San Pablo Colleges in 1947. From its humble beginnings in makeshift rooms and rented buildings, the San Pablo Colleges in a brief span of five years acquired a one-half hectare piece of the walled lot at Hermanos Belen Street, in the heart of the City of San Pablo. Dr. Antonio Azores was its first President. It was during Dr. Alipâ€™s tenure that full government recognition was granted to the Grade School, the Secondary School, and courses in Secretarial, Education, Commerce, Liberal Arts, and Law.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, it was in the middle 1950s that the San Pablo Colleges began to build its prestige in becoming one of the notable institutions in this part of the country, and it was also at this time that a comprehensive building program was undertaken. Judge Paulo de Gala Macasaet, considered the father of this Golden Era of Renaissance, was Chairman of the board of Trustees and later College President. During his time the Graduate Institute and the Nursing Course were successively recognized, which then inspired him in coming up with the objective: A school that would be second to none.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This quest for educational excellence initiated by Judge Macasaet is now the very goal pursued by his successors. The present leadership has embarked on programs seeking the accreditation of its course and has been continuously searching on how the teaching-learning process will not only be effective and efficient but relevant as well. As everyone knows education is ever-growing and there is no end to its progress. Every generation shall have its contribution and for now, there is no substitute for the development of the College we all love and revere.
