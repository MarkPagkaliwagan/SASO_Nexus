            Brief History of the San Pablo Colleges
          </p>
          <p>
            To meet the needs of the growing school-age population of the City of San
            Pablo and its neighboring towns, a group of pioneering men, among them Major
            Ricardo Bonilla, Dr. Antonio Azores, Mr. Ambrosio Alcantara, and many others
            founded and established the San Pablo Colleges in 1947. From its humble
            beginnings in makeshift rooms and rented buildings, the San Pablo Colleges in
            a brief span of five years acquired a one-half hectare piece of the walled
            lot at Hermanos Belen Street, in the heart of the City of San Pablo. Dr.
            Antonio Azores was its first President. It was during Dr. Alipâ€™s tenure that
            full government recognition was granted to the Grade School, the Secondary
            School, and courses in Secretarial, Education, Commerce, Liberal Arts, and
            Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it was in the middle 1950s that the San Pablo Colleges began to
            build its prestige in becoming one of the notable institutions in this part
            of the country, and it was also at this time that a comprehensive building
            program was undertaken. Judge Paulo de Gala Macasaet, considered the father
            of this Golden Era of Renaissance, was Chairman of the board of Trustees and
            later College President. During his time the Graduate Institute and the
            Nursing Course were successively recognized, which then inspired him in
            coming up with the objective: A school that would be second to none.
          </p>
          <p>
            This quest for educational excellence initiated by Judge Macasaet is now the
            very goal pursued by his successors. The present leadership has embarked on
            programs seeking the accreditation of its course and has been continuously
            searching on how the teaching-learning process will not only be effective and
            efficient but relevant as well. As everyone knows education is ever-growing
            and there is no end to its progress. Every generation shall have its
            contribution and for now, there is no substitute for the development of the
            College we all love and revere.
